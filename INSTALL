CLAHRC WISH is a web application built and run with JBoss SEAM framework.
The installation instructions assume the following environment:
Ubuntu 13.04
MySQL 5.6
JBoss AS 7.1.1.Final
Java 1.6
Apache ANT 1.8
Git 1.8


1. Download source distribution into a WISH_DISTRO directory from GitHub.
	# git clone https://github.com/clahrc-wish/wish-core-src.git

2. Create WISH core database.
   2.1 If not done so, download and install MySQL DB server into a MYSQL_HOME directory.
   2.2 Using MySQL admin account run:
		# ${MYSQL_HOME}/bin/mysql -u root -p < ${WISH_DISTRO}/resources/sql/clahrc2_core.sql

3. Configure JBoss AS.
   3.1 If not done so, download and install JBoss AS into a JBOSS_HOME directory.
   3.2 Create a new 'module' directory to hold MySQL connector used at runtime by WISH:
		# mkdir ${JBOSS_HOME}/modules/com/mysql
		# mkdir ${JBOSS_HOME}/modules/com/mysql/main	
	
	3.3 Copy into this new 'main' module subdirectory all files found in
	    '${WISH_DISTRO}/resources/jboss/modules/mysql'.
	    
	3.4 Create a new 'module' directory to hold WISH runtime configuration files.
		# mkdir ${JBOSS_HOME}/modules/uk
		# mkdir ${JBOSS_HOME}/modules/uk/ac
		# mkdir ${JBOSS_HOME}/modules/uk/ac/ic
		# mkdir ${JBOSS_HOME}/modules/uk/ac/ic/clahrc
		# mkdir ${JBOSS_HOME}/modules/uk/ac/ic/clahrc/resources
		# mkdir ${JBOSS_HOME}/modules/uk/ac/ic/clahrc/resources/main
	
	3.5 Copy into this new 'main' module subdirectory all files found in
	    '${WISH_DISTRO}/resources/jboss/modules/wish'.
		    
    Make sure the newly created 'module' direcotry and file permissions are correctly set for 
	the account used to run the JBoss AS instance.
	 
	3.6 Edit the JBoss AS standalone configuration file - '${JBOSS_HOME}/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml'
        In the section '<datasources>' add a new '<datasource>'. 
        Copy into it the '<datasource>' content from '${WISH_DISTRO}/resources/jboss/configuration/standalone.xml'
        In the section '<drivers>' add a new '<driver>'. 
        Copy into it the '<driver>' content from '${WISH_DISTRO}/resources/jboss/configuration/standalone.xml'
       
	3.7 If not done so, configure the JBoss AS launch script. An example script for Ubuntu 13.04 is included in
	    '${WISH_DISTRO}/resources/jboss/configuration/jboss-as'.
	    The file requires two configuration files in '/etc/java' and '/etc/jboss-as' directories, create if necessery.
	    Copy to these directories the example configuration files found in '${WISH_DISTRO}/resources/jboss/configuration/java.conf'
	    and '${WISH_DISTRO}/resources/jboss/configuration/jboss-as.conf' respectively - if needed, modify them to match the new environment.
	    
4. Build WISH WAR archive.
   4.1 Edit the '${WISH_DISTRO}/build.xml' file and make sure that:
      4.1.1 the value of the 'property name="project.name"' is whatever you want to name your archive file - default is - 'value="clahrc2-core-jb7"'
      4.1.2 the value of the 'property name="jboss.home.dir" points to the directory where Jboss AS is installed - default is - 'value="../../jboss-as-7.1.1.Final"'
   
   4.2 Using the Apache ANT, execute the targets for building and archiving.
   		# cp ${WISH_DISTRO}
   		# ${APACHE_ANT}/bin/ant clean archive
   If successful, this will result in a generated '${project.name}.war' file.
   
5. Deploy the WISH WAR onto the JBoss AS instance - i.e. copy the '${project.name}.war' generated in (4.) to the '${JBOSS_HOME}/standalone/deployments/' directory.
   To access the WISH login page - open a browser and go to 'http://<JBossAS URL>/wish'.
