        <p>Web Improvement Support in Healthcare (WISH) is a model-driven collaborative software infrastructure for data capture and live reporting of project-specific improvement measures. WISH was originally developed for the needs of CLAHRC Northwest London where it has been successfully deployed in over 50 improvement initiatives, with over 700 named users. It is currently being piloted in three large external projects.</p>

<p>WISH was designed to provide full software support for improvement teams wanting to implement evidence-based interventions in their environments. It is a collaborative, enterprise tool that supports multiple concurrent improvement initiatives, with users who can be parts of different initiatives in various roles. The data collected and analysis provided in each initiative consists of quantitative measures, bespoke to each project, and a set of generic qualitative data measures, including Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles, improvement sustainability data and others. The collected data is immediately accessible to users as a set of live reports, and the software runs inside a standard web browser. Its key features are shown in \ref{tab:features}, together with the improvement challenges they address.</p>

<p>The need for custom data models for different projects led WISH to be designed as a model-driven tool. Each project has associated with itself a user-defined improvement model that is encoded as XML and automatically translated into a data structure in an underlying MySQL database, a set of pages in the data collection framework based on JBoss Seam, and a set of live reports using Eclipse Business Intelligence Reporting Toolkit (BIRT). This approach minimises the technical effort needed for adding new improvement initiatives, and removes it completely from the improvement teams, which can then concentrate on producing a model most appropriate to their problem. </p>
